								The construction of the Colosseum began in the year 72 under the empire of Vespasian and was finished in the year 80 during the rule of the emperor Titus. After completion, the Colosseum became the greatest Roman amphitheatre, measuring 188 meters in length, 156 meters in width and 57 meters in height.

		 							The Leaning Tower of Pisa is one of the most unique architectural structures from medieval Europe. Designed to stand as a straight bell tower, it began to lean even before it was finished due to soft foundations. The tower stands at 185 feet high and leans at an angle of 5 degrees.
									Work has been done to try to straighten the tower. Now, tourists can yet again climb the staircase inside the bell tower. Engineers expect the tower to be stable for another 200 years.

The structure, completed around 126-128 A.D. during the reign of Emperor Hadrian, features a rotunda with a massive domed ceiling that was the largest of its kind when it was built. The Pantheon is situated on the site of an earlier structure of the same name, built around 25 B.C. by statesman Marcus Agrippa, and is thought to have been designed as a temple for Roman gods.
